		<title>The Losers&apos; Club: A Stephen King Podcast</title>
		<description>Founded in 2017, The Losers’ Club® is an award-winning weekly series that chronologically digs through the work of Stephen King with humor, irreverence, and a critical eye. Each episode, the Losers gather together to read between the iconic pages and share the latest in King’s Dominion, whether it’s the author’s oft-controversial tweets, the boldest Hollywood headlines, or his endless forthcoming projects. The series also regularly features special guests. In the past, the Losers have spoken to Mike Flanagan, Thomas Jane, Tananarive Due, Chapo Trap House, Owen Teague, Mick Garris, Mary Lambert, Jerry O’Connell, Wil Wheaton, Joe Bob Briggs, and even King himself.

		Suitable for readers both Constant and casual. King says check us out.

		Edited by Kyle Orozovich. Music by The Most/Charlie Laurence. Produced by Michael Roffman and Randall Colburn.</description>

			<title>CrichtonCast: Jurassic Park (1990)</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[Welcome to CrichtonCast, our Michael Crichton spinoff podcast exclusive to The Barrens. Today, we're unlocking last year's episode on Crichton's seventh novel, 1990's Jurassic Park, in light of the new Jurassic taking a bite out of the box office this week. 

				Host Randall Colburn is joined by Losers Michael Roffman, Dan Caffrey, and Justin Gerber on Isla Nublar as they meditate on all the prehistoric monsters -- from our universal affinity for dinosaurs to objective science research to the film effect and more.

				Want to hear our thoughts on this book's sequel The Lost World? Head to The Barrens: patreon.com/thebarrens. We're dropping that episode later this month -- and it's gonna be another exploration filled with fun facts, great bits, and dino DNA.

			<title>Danse Macabre: The Amityville Horror</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[George and Kathy Lutz moved into 112 Ocean Avenue in Amityville, New York, in December 1975, roughly one year after its previous residents were shot and killed in their sleep. They fled less than a month later, leaving behind their belongings and claiming to have been terrorized by demonic forces. This story served as the basis for Jay Anson’s 1977 book, which itself spawned nine follow-ups, more than 60 films, and countless parodies and homages. 

				A half a century later, what’s it like to revisit the non-fiction (?) book that started it all? The Losers’ Club finds that out in the latest episode of their Danse Macabre series, in which they discuss the books and movies recommended by King in his 1981 horror treatise of the same name. Losers Jenn Adams, Randall Colburn, Ashley Casseday, and Ana Marie Cox unpack the disputations, lawsuits, and defenses that color the book’s history, as well as whether you can ever read a story as it was originally intended after its been fed through the pop cultural gristmill.

			<description>
				<![CDATA[The Losers are back in The Stacks for another round for recommendations, digressions, and musings about the joys of the written word.

Jordan scooping up the rights to some BookTok favorites. Then we share our own recommendations, which span fiction and non, horror and sci-fi, and releases new and old. Two are about video games and one inspired 1987's Angel Heart. Pretty rad. Check out an abbreviated list of our recs below.

				Girl on Girl: How Pop Culture Turned a Generation of Women Against Themselves by Sophie Gilbert
				The Lady from the Black Lagoon: Hollywood Monsters and the Lost Legacy of Milicent Patrick by Mallory O'Meara

			<description>
				<![CDATA[“If it bleeds, it leads.” In the second of two episodes dedicated to Stephen King's 2020 novellas collection If It Bleeds, Losers Randall Colburn, Michael Roffman, Dan Caffrey, and Jenn Adams discuss the titular and final novella, "If It Bleeds". Together, they parse through King’s true crime era and what the future of Holly Gibney might bring, be it on the page or in another season of HBO’s The Outsider.

			<title>The Institute</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[A scoop of Firestarter, a dash of IT, and just a soupçon of Carrie and The Shining — Stephen King’s novel The Institute is like a bowl brimming with the author’s greatest hits. But does it go down smooth? That’s what the Losers’ Club asks in their episode about the 2019 tome, which takes readers inside the eponymous Institute where a mysterious gaggle of doctors, scientists, and thugs subject psychically-touched children to terrible tests, many of which border on pure torture. 

				Join the gang as they dissect what the story has to say about friendship, U.S. foreign policy, and the youth of today. Questions abound! Can King write modern kids as well as he can those of the ‘50s and ‘60s? How does the paranoia of early books like Firestarter and The Stand factor in here? Does adding “-ster” to someone’s name make for a good nickname? They also comb through the book’s reviews and King’s pre-release interviews to puzzle over the relentless comparisons to the crisis at the Southern border. Weird stuff.

That’s what the Losers’ Club asks in their episode about the 2019 tome, which takes readers inside the eponymous Institute where a mysterious gaggle of doctors, scientists, and thugs subject psychically-touched children to terrible tests, many of which border on pure torture. 

			Join the gang as they dissect what the story has to say about friendship, U.S. foreign policy, and the youth of today. Questions abound! Can King write modern kids as well as he can those of the ‘50s and ‘60s? How does the paranoia of early books like Firestarter and The Stand factor in here? Does adding “-ster” to someone’s name make for a good nickname? They also comb through the book’s reviews and King’s pre-release interviews to puzzle over the relentless comparisons to the crisis at the Southern border. Weird stuff.</itunes:subtitle>

			<title>Ranking Stephen King&apos;s Baddest Boys</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[This month's book episode is The Institute. In anticipation, we're unlocking this spirited ranking episode from 2023 in which the Losers talk about their favorite Bad Boys in King's Dominion. Instead of listing and ranking, however, we’re gonna let the Boys do what they do best and duke it out with each other until only one remains. As per tradition, the Losers use a March-Madness style Bracket to narrow down the competitors to a grand champion. For more of these kind of bracket episodes, join The Barrens: patreon.com/thebarrens.

It’s stiff competition, but thankfully your hosts Jenn Adams, Dan Caffrey, Rachel Reeves, and Julia Marchese are on hand to wade through the overturned tables and broken dishes. With a March Madness-style bracket, they’ll pit each family against each other till only one remains to claim the title of King’s Worst Family.</p><p>Note: This episode was recorded in November 2023 and is being unlocked ahead of Thanksgiving 2024.</p><p><strong>Follow us on </strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/losersclubpod/"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/LosersClubPod"><strong>Twitter</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thelosersclubpodcast/"><strong>Instagram</strong></a><strong> </strong>| <a href="https://www.patreon.com/thebarrens"><strong>Patreon</strong></a></p>

			<itunes:title>Ranking Stephen King&apos;s Worst Families</itunes:title>
			<itunes:author>Bloody FM</itunes:author>
			<itunes:duration>01:49:04</itunes:duration>
			<itunes:summary>Holiday dinners can be minefields. Your pretentious cousin won’t stop talking about her year abroad, your mom keeps asking when you plan to have kids, and your drunk uncle just spilled red wine all over the green bean casserole. Sometimes the tricks don’t end with Halloween and even the best sweet potato casserole can’t make up for the stress of listening to your dad go on yet another political rant. 
			But Constant Readers may rest assured that no matter what horrors may lie under your granny’s covered casserole dish, they won’t be as bad as the terrible families lurking in King’s Dominion. From the Cunninghams to the Hartsfields, the master of horror seems to delight in showing us the dark secrets that lie within every hearth and home. 
			This episode features a sour 16 of sinister clans each duking it out to be named the family you’d least like to visit for the holidays. It’s stiff competition, but thankfully your hosts Jenn Adams, Dan Caffrey, Rachel Reeves, and Julia Marchese are on hand to wade through the overturned tables and broken dishes. With a March Madness-style bracket, they’ll pit each family against each other till only one remains to claim the title of King’s Worst Family.
			Note: This episode was recorded in November 2023 and is being unlocked ahead of Thanksgiving 2024.

			<title>Stephen King&apos;s Earliest Stories with Bev Vincent</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[<p>To celebrate the release of King’s latest shortest story collection <strong><em>You Like It Darker</em></strong>, we’re unlocking our premiere episode of The Stephen King Archives, our Patreon exclusive imprint in which your Losers search the vault of Stephen King material – dusting off unpublished short stories, long-forgotten interviews, coffee-stained manuscripts, and alternate versions of your favorite tales.</p><p>This particular episode, recorded in 2021, zeroes in on King’s earliest stories – his roots, if you will – 1956’s "Jhonathan and the Witchs" 1963’s <strong><em>The Aftermath</em></strong>, and 1965’s "I Was a Teenage Grave Robber". What are these stories? Where did they come from? Listen ahead as Losers Randall Colburn, Jenn Adams, and myself parse through these early, early works.

They also discuss the book’s messy vision of a post-recession America and its musings on class, second chances, and the nature of evil. It’s also one of King’s poundcakiest books, so prepare to blush.</p><p><strong>Follow us on </strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/losersclubpod/"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/LosersClubPod"><strong>Twitter</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thelosersclubpodcast/"><strong>Instagram</strong></a><strong> </strong>| <a href="https://www.patreon.com/thebarrens"><strong>Patreon</strong></a></p>

			<title>Kingdom Hospital Miniseries Review</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[<p>Nearly three decades ago, Stephen King stumbled upon a copy of Lars von Trier's Danish miniseries <em>The Kingdom</em> in a dusty Colorado video store. Roughly seven years later, ABC premiered <em>Kingdom Hospital,</em> the author's own take on von Trier's haunted hospital. While conceived as a miniseries, King was so excited about the project — developed alongside his <em>Storm of the Century</em> and <em>Rose Red</em> collaborators — that he was ready to start work on a second season. The series premiered strong, but ratings dwindled and ABC pulled the plug just months later. </p><p>Join the Losers as they unpack both the 13-episode series and King's candid thoughts about the adaptation and its swift cancellation, which he detailed in a 2004 EW column. Was it ahead of its time? Are the <em>Twin Peaks</em> comparisons warranted? And just how much did it inspire season 2 of <em>American Horror Story</em>? These questions and more — including its place in the larger canon of King's work — are discussed.</p><p><strong>Follow us on </strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/losersclubpod/"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/LosersClubPod"><strong>Twitter</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thelosersclubpodcast/"><strong>Instagram</strong></a><strong> </strong>| <a href="https://www.patreon.com/thebarrens"><strong>Patreon</strong></a></p>

			<itunes:summary>This past December marked the 40th anniversary of John Carpenter&apos;s Christine. To celebrate, the Losers are revisiting the 1983 adaptation of the 1983 novel -- more on that later -- with their first Long Watch movie review episode in over a year. Joining the gang for the ride is Kayleigh Jensen of the Glitter &amp; Gore podcast. Together, they chart the (very) short production history from page to screen, the iconography of the Plymouth Fury, the sounds of the film, and those timeless effects.

				<![CDATA[<p>If you recall from last week’s episode, we’re spending the next two months catching up on all the Stephen King adaptations and anniversaries we missed over the past year. So, to stay on theme, we’re unlocking a very topical episode of The Stephen King Archives, our Patreon exclusive imprint in which your Losers search the vault of Stephen King material – dusting off unpublished short stories, long-forgotten interviews, coffee-stained manuscripts, and alternate versions of your favorite tales. This particular entry was recorded in June 2022 and finds the Losers dusting off their copy of <strong><em>Stephen King’s World of Horror</em></strong>. </p><p>Released in 1986, the 45-minute doc covers the works of King and his influence on pop culture. Peppered between segments with King are a number of clips from essential horror titles alongside interviews with John Carpenter, Clive Barker, Tom Savini, etc. Together, Randall, Mike, and Jenn revisit the analog era of being a horror fan, digress on King's myriad quotes throughout the 45 minute special, and chew on the evolution of pop culture icons. And, naturally, as we’re wont to do, we detour into a number of unexpected tangents, the likes of which lead us to places both wonderful and strange.</p><p><strong>Follow us on </strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/losersclubpod/"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/LosersClubPod"><strong>Twitter</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thelosersclubpodcast/"><strong>Instagram</strong></a><strong> </strong>| <a href="https://www.patreon.com/thebarrens"><strong>Patreon</strong></a></p>

			<description>
				<![CDATA[<p>We (mostly) kept JFK conspiracy talk out of our <em>11/22/63</em> episodes, as the story is best enjoyed on King's terms. We did, however, think it would be enriching to chat with some smart people about King's assertion that "it is very, very difficult for a reasonable person to believe" that Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't the lone shooter.</p><p>Previously, we spoke with Brendan James of <em>Blowback</em> about the book, Oswald, and King’s political evolution. You can find that episode just a bit further down the feed. Now, we're speaking with Jim DiEugenio, one of the leading experts on the political assassinations of the 1960s. Jim is the author of two books about the Kennedy Assassination, one of which was the basis for Oliver Stone’s documentary <em>JFK Revisited: Through the Looking Glass</em>. He also has a new book out, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/JFK-Assassination-Chokeholds-Prove-Conspiracy/dp/B0CMTHBLDL"><em>The JFK Assassination Chokeholds</em></a> and a website, KennedysandKing.com, that's loaded with resources.  </p><p>Since Jim knows Kennedy scholarship like the back of his hand, we chatted with him about the research materials King cites in the afterword to <em>11/22/63</em>, the ones that make him “98 to 99 percent” sure that Oswald acted alone. Jim also wanted to discuss an interview King did with filmmaker Errol Morris for <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/10/errol-morris-interviews-stephen-king/"><em>The New York Times</em></a> in November 2011, so it may be worth it to hit pause and give that interview a read before listening.

			<title>Finding Stephen King in Garth Marenghi&apos;s Darkplace with Popular Music&apos;s Zac Pennington</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[<p><em>The Losers' Club</em>'s Randall Colburn is joined by one of his favorite songwriters, Zac Pennington (Popular Music/Parenthetical Girls), to unpack the parodic pleasures of U.K. cult hit <em>Garth Marenghi's Darkplace</em>, a loony hospital horror soap that's maybe-sorta-definitely taking the piss out of Stephen King (in the most loving way possible, of course). The pair discuss low-rent '80s horror, hearing Matt Berry's voice for the first time, and how genuinely strange it is that <em>Darkplace</em> came out just <em>months</em> before King's own <em>Kingdom Hospital</em>, his short-lived ABC hospital horror soap. Popular Music's lush and haunting new album, <a href="https://www.popularmusic.rip/pre-order-minor-works/"><em>Minor Works</em></a>, is available now. Order it here and stream it wherever you stream music. </p><p><strong>Follow us on </strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/losersclubpod/"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/LosersClubPod"><strong>Twitter</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thelosersclubpodcast/"><strong>Instagram</strong></a><strong> </strong>| <a href="https://www.patreon.com/thebarrens"><strong>Patreon</strong></a></p>

			<description>
				<![CDATA[<p>Today marks the 25th anniversary of <em>Apt Pupil,</em> the 1998 Stephen King adaptation that stars the late Brad Renfro and Sir Ian McKellen. Admittedly, it's a very controversial film to discuss, but to their credit, our friends Joe Lipsett and Trace Thurman of the <strong><em>Horror Queers</em></strong> braved the unnerving themes and backstories within the production. They also invited our co-host Jenn Adams along to help 'em out. So, we thought: Why not shed a light on the film -- consider it a Long Watch -- and give our network pals the spotlight, too. Win-win.

			<title>Introducing The Lady Killers: A Feminine Rage Podcast</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[<p>Happy Friday the 13th, Constant Listeners! We have a special treat for you: Another series from the LC family. It's called <strong>The Lady Killers: a Feminine Rage Podcast</strong>, and it's hosted by fellow Losers Jenn Adams and Sammie Kuykendall, in addition to Halloweenies editor Mae Shults and Rue Morgue editor Rocco Thompson. So what's the gist? Each episode will feature Jenn, Sammie, Mae, and Rocco discussing a female-identifying killer in the horror genre—and sometimes the wider world of cinema—from Julia and Jennifer to Carrie and Christine. They’ll tell the story from her point of view, decide if it’s “Good For Her” Horror, and answer the most important question of all: would we die for her? New episodes every Thursday; <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-lady-killers-a-feminine-rage-podcast/id1710501948">subscribe now.</a></p><p><br /></p>

And what&apos;s going on with Junior? Randall, Ashley, and the Dans also sift through the book&apos;s hundreds-deep ensemble in search of their favorite supporting characters, from the drug-addled Chef to the tragic Dinsmore clan. Along the way, they discuss evolutions in King&apos;s leading men, the fun parts of meth, and the shared delusions that connect the book&apos;s most disparate characters.

			<description>
				<![CDATA[<p>Your favorite little worker ants are wiggling in the lens of your magnifying glass in the first our three (!) episodes about Stephen King's 1,100-page <em>Under the Dome</em>. In this episode, the Losers unpack the 2009 book's decades-long history, King's quotes about its creation, and the political and social climate that influenced its themes. Dick Cheney, evangelicalism, and Wolf Blitzer (?) color a conversation that sets the story against King's other small town epics and his career-long exploration of individualism vs. collectivism. Stay tuned for Pt. 2 next Friday!</p><p><strong>Follow on </strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/losersclubpod/"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/LosersClubPod"><strong>Twitter</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thelosersclubpodcast/"><strong>Instagram</strong></a><strong> </strong>| <a href="https://www.patreon.com/thebarrens"><strong>Patreon</strong></a></p>

			<title>Ranking Stephen King&apos;s Writers</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[<p>Of all the advice Stephen King offers in his memoir <em>On Writing</em>, “write what you know” may be the best.

			<title>Debating Stephen King&apos;s Luckiest Characters</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[<p>It's St. Patrick's Day! To celebrate, the Losers untie another big ol' Bag of Bones and answer <em>your</em> questions.

Together, they meditate on the reverberations of 9/11 throughout the post-apocalyptic novel, the parallels to H.G.

			<itunes:summary>One club welcomes another on the latest installment of The Losers’ Club’s On Writers series. This week, Losers Randall Colburn and Mel Kassel chat with acclaimed novelist Paul G. Tremblay about last year’s The Pallbearers Club. Tremblay unpacks his careful approach to ambiguity and the necessity he feels to earn his experiments with narrative. He also discusses A Knock at the Cabin, the M. Night Shyamalan-directed adaptation of his Bram Stoker Award-winning novel The Cabin at the End of the World, and his experience as a novelist in Hollywood. He also teases his next novel, which centers around a “cursed” film production, and offers an update on the long-gestating film adaptation of his 2015 breakout A Head Full of Ghosts. And, yes, Stephen King is discussed.

Together, they discuss the origins of the Hard Case Crime imprint, how Stephen King got involved, the ways this peculiar parable is built on hard-boiled tropes, and how it all aligns with From a Buick 8 and beyond.

				<![CDATA[<p>Next week, the Losers will begin their much-anticipated final coverage of The Dark Tower with the first of two book episodes dedicated to the epic 2004 closer. In anticipation, we're unlocking this quirky, spoiler-filled discussion about the Crimson King from way, way back in August of 2020.

So, join Rockin' Randall Colburn, Dan Caffrey, and Dan Pfleegor as they discuss the King's murky origins, the ways he threads the multiverse, and, most importantly, whether or not they think the King is cool.

			<itunes:summary>Next week, the Losers will begin their much-anticipated final coverage of The Dark Tower with the first of two book episodes dedicated to the epic 2004 closer. In anticipation, we&apos;re unlocking this quirky, spoiler-filled discussion about the Crimson King from way, way back in August of 2020. At the time, we were just wrapping up our book episode on Insomnia, so it felt right to discuss Big Red.

			Now, as we reach the Tower, it makes even more sense to head into the Court of the Crimson King. So, join Rockin&apos; Randall Colburn, Dan Caffrey, and Dan Pfleegor as they discuss the King&apos;s murky origins, the ways he threads the multiverse, and, most importantly, whether or not they think the King is cool. Again, there will be spoilers -- spotty as their memories are -- so listen at your own risk.

Join the Losers as they team up with Troop D and head to Shed B to unpack this four-cylinder supernatural horror story. Together they muse over muscle cars, try to avoid one of the more harrowing deaths to ever grace our sematary section, and debate whether or not this is the saddest and most nihilistic book in King&apos;s canon.

			<title>Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes: From the Stories of Stephen King TV Review</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[<p>As we near the end of our coverage surrounding Everything's Eventual, the Losers look toward TNT's oft-forgotten anthology series <em>Nightmares & Dreamscapes: From the Stories of Stephen King</em>. Join Losers Randall Colburn, Michael Roffman, and Jenn Adams as they take a wormhole back to 2006 to discuss more recently covered stories like "The Road Virus Heads North" and "Autopsy Room Four", in addition to stories from the titular collection. Elsewhere, the three also discuss the series' godawful CGI, the surprising physical turn of the late William Hurt, the enduring underdog appeal of Ron Livingston, and so much more. It should be noted this episode was originally recorded in June 2020 -- right around the time we covered Nightmares & Dreamscapes -- and has since been unlocked from The Barrens (Patreon).

Clocking in at around 3.5 hours, this whopper of an episode dissects both volumes of the blockbuster fourth season, covering the kids, the adults, the '80s references, their favorite needle drops, and, naturally, all the connections to Stephen King.

(You know, as he listed in 1981's <em>Danse Macabre</em>. Ahem, hence the name of this series.)

Join Michael Roffman, Jenn Adams, Ana Marie Cox, and Justin Gerber as they chart the rise and fall of the literary horror wave of the '70s, debate the MVP of the Chowder Society, point out the literary influences, connect the dots to King's Dominion, and share their own spine-tingling ghost stories.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Follow us on </strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/losersclubpod/"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/LosersClubPod"><strong>Twitter</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thelosersclubpodcast/"><strong>Instagram</strong></a> | <a href="https://www.patreon.com/thebarrens"><strong>Patreon</strong></a></p><p><br /></p><p>Hosted on Acast.

			<title>Y2King: The Plant and Riding the Bullet</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[<p>It's Y2King! The Losers dial back to 2000 and revisit Stephen King's two e-books: the as-yet-unfinished <em>The Plant</em> and the "Riding the Bullet".

			<title>Danse Macabre: Something Wicked This Way Comes</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[<p>Danse Macabre is a recurring feature of <em>The Losers' Club</em> that journeys through all the books that influenced Stephen King. (You know, as he listed in 1981's <em>Danse Macabre</em>. Ahem, hence the name of this series.) In the past, this feature has flipped through the pages of Shirley Jackson's <em>The Haunting of Hill House</em> and William Golding's <em>Lord of the Flies</em>. Today, however, the Losers find themselves in Green Town, Illinois revisiting Ray Bradbury's 1962 dark fantasy novel, <em>Something Wicked This Way Comes</em>. Join Dan Caffrey, Rachel Reeves, Mel Kassel, and Michael Roffman as they praise Bradbury's autumnal prose, lose themselves to bizarre Gene Kelly tangents, connect the dots to King's Dominion, and wrestle with the endurance of imagination.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Follow us on </strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/losersclubpod/"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/LosersClubPod"><strong>Twitter</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thelosersclubpodcast/"><strong>Instagram</strong></a> | <a href="https://www.patreon.com/thebarrens"><strong>Patreon</strong></a></p><p><br /></p><p>Hosted on Acast.

			<title>Mick Garris&apos; Bag of Bones Miniseries</title>
			<description>

			<title>SK Tours of Maine on Growing Up in the Land of Stephen King</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[<p>The standpipe. The sematary. The Jade. The gates. The world of Stephen King is vast and infinite, at least on paper. In reality, King's Dominion is nestled snuggly within Bangor, Maine, the third largest city in the seaside state and arguably its greatest source for tourism. After all, thousands of Constant Readers descend upon the New England town each year in the hopes of finding King's own stomping grounds.

			<title>Finding Stephen King at the End of Fear Street</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[<p><em>Fear Street</em> is on the mind lately, thanks to Netflix's new trilogy of films this month from director Leigh Janiak (see: <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3671849/review-fear-street-part-1-1994-carves-solid-ode-90s-slashers/"><em>Fear Street 1994</em></a>, <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3672761/review-fear-street-part-2-1978-pays-respects-classic-slashers-higher-body-count/"><em>1978</em></a>, <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/videos/3673504/fear-street-part-3-1666-300-year-nightmare-comes-end-friday-trailer/"><em>1666</em></a>). Because of this, the Losers have teamed up with Kelly Nugent and Lindsay Katai of the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/teen-creeps/id1133865220"><em>Teen Creeps</em></a> podcast to chart their respective journeys from Shadyside to King's Dominion -- a journey familiar to many. Beyond King, however, the four discuss their <em>Fear Street</em> origins, their favorite titles, the recurring themes and motifs of the series, and why Stine's work continues to resonate with newer generations today. They also weigh in on Janiak's trilogy and debate whether or not the films capture the spirit and tone of the books.

				<![CDATA[<p>One night as the Losers were asleep in the clubhouse they share in Derry, Maine, a mysterious knock came at the door. Upon opening it, they discovered not a person, but a bundle of decaying, handwritten pages. After transcribing them by candlelight, the Losers realized they were reading the teleplay for the lost first episode of Season 3 of Hulu’s <em>Castle Rock</em>.<strong> </strong>Naturally, your humble hosts sought to bring the script to life in the best way they know how: <strong>By turning it into a podcast with no affiliation whatsoever to Hulu or the creators. </strong></p><br /><p><strong>﻿</strong>Today, <em>The Losers' Club</em> is proud to present the first of the audio drama's three acts, which begin with the arrivals of a Dark Man, a beleaguered detective, a fire-spewing vigilante, a psychic drifter, and horror’s most famous vintage automobile. It's a story as engrossing as it is asinine, and littered with more Easter eggs than you can count on, well, 19 hands. Stream the first episode now and stay tuned for Act II and Act III to follow in the coming weeks. Rest assured, all three acts will be stitched together as one long episode come August.</p><br /><p>Production by Cat Blackard. Edited by Kyle Orozovich.

			<itunes:summary>One night as the Losers were asleep in the clubhouse they share in Derry, Maine, a mysterious knock came at the door. Upon opening it, they discovered not a person, but a bundle of decaying, handwritten pages. After transcribing them by candlelight, the Losers realized they were reading the teleplay for the lost first episode of Season 3 of Hulu’s Castle Rock. Naturally, your humble hosts sought to bring the script to life in the best way they know how: By turning it into a podcast with no affiliation whatsoever to Hulu or the creators. 
			﻿Today, The Losers&apos; Club is proud to present the first of the audio drama&apos;s three acts, which begin with the arrivals of a Dark Man, a beleaguered detective, a fire-spewing vigilante, a psychic drifter, and horror’s most famous vintage automobile. It&apos;s a story as engrossing as it is asinine, and littered with more Easter eggs than you can count on, well, 19 hands. Stream the first episode now and stay tuned for Act II and Act III to follow in the coming weeks. Rest assured, all three acts will be stitched together as one long episode come August.

			<title>Behind the Curtain of the Stephen King Rules Film Fest</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[<p>Losers Mike Roffman and Jenn Adams are joined by the fine folks behind this weekend’s Stephen King Rules Dollar Baby Film Festival. Filmmaker James Douglas and producer Norm Coyne discuss what went into making this three-day fiesta a reality, their reaction to receiving the Stephen King Bump online (not once, but multiple times), and the diversity behind their slate of films.

Along the way, they visit New York City and stop by The Manhattan Restaurant of the Mind to pick up Stephen King&apos;s new hardboiled crime novel, Later. Join Losers Randall Colburn, Michael Roffman, McKenzie Gerber, and Rachel Reeves as they discuss the new rules of the dead, the book&apos;s ties to King&apos;s Dominion, and whether or not the twist works or flops.

They'll discuss the benefits to writing as Bachman and the emotional core of this darker style. Is King funny? Would we read his published laundry list? Why is Richard Bachman so mad?

In the second of two episodes dedicated to the book, they discuss Tak, body horror, and the terror of unbridled authority.

			<description>
				<![CDATA[<p>The Losers head down Highway 50 out in Nevada and make a pit stop in a small mining town called Desperation. It's hot, it's eerie, and it's seemingly abandoned. To their surprise, though, there's a lone deputy waving them in. He seems nice. Join Losers Randall Colburn, Jenn Adams, Dan Pfleegor, and Ana Marie Cox as they begin their coverage of Stephen King's 1996 novel. In the first of two episodes dedicated to the book, they discuss its themes of addiction, relationship to faith, and grisly scenery. Things take an emotional turn when the Losers weigh in on how they personally react to the book, their own evolving journeys with religion, and their own experiences with addiction, recovery, and AA. Needless to say, there is much to mine in <em>Desperation</em>.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Follow us on </strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/losersclubpod/"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/LosersClubPod"><strong>Twitter</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thelosersclubpodcast/"><strong>Instagram</strong></a><strong> </strong>| <a href="https://www.patreon.com/thebarrens"><strong>Patreon</strong></a></p><p><br /></p><p>Hosted on Acast.

			<title>Disgraceland&apos;s Jake Brennan on Conspiracies, Ghosts, and Stephen King</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[<p>Grab a flashlight, put on a pair of gloves, and make sure you've got a sturdy stomach -- we’re talkin’ true crime.

So, join Losers Randall Colburn, Dan Caffrey, Michael Roffman, and Dan Pfleegor as they leave the big cities for the heart of America. Along the way, they discuss the schmaltzy overtones between Stu and Frannie, make fun of Ralph Brentner, and, yes, listen to Crowded House.

			<description>
				<![CDATA[<p>The Losers are <em>finally</em> closing the book on Stephen King's <em>Nightmares and Dreamscapes</em> after two long months of coverage. To clean up shop, they're revisiting the remaining adaptations to discuss, specifically 2009’s <em>Dolan’s Cadillac</em>, 1997’s <em>The</em> <em>Night Flier</em>, "Chattery Teeth" from 1997’s <em>Quicksilver Highway</em>, and "The Moving Finger" from 1991’s <em>Monsters</em>. Unfortunately, they couldn't find a stream of "Sorry, Right Number" from the fourth season of <em>Tales from the Darkside</em>, so that one remains lost in the thinny. Alas, topics range from Christian Slater's mid-aughts career, to the sexual appeal of Miguel Ferrer, to the Golden Age of horror anthologies, and, naturally, to Tom Selleck.

Unfortunately, they couldn&apos;t find a stream of &quot;Sorry, Right Number&quot; from the fourth season of Tales from the Darkside, so that one remains lost in the thinny. Alas, topics range from Christian Slater&apos;s mid-aughts career, to the sexual appeal of Miguel Ferrer, to the Golden Age of horror anthologies, and, naturally, to Tom Selleck. You&apos;ve been warned.

				<![CDATA[<p>“When an old man dies, a library burns.” It's lonely out here in the Harrigan estate. The sun's dwindling through the windows, the African lilacs are all watered, everything's been cleaned two times over. The only thing left is silence and the echoes of history.

Join Losers Randall Colburn, Michael Roffman, Dan Caffrey, and Jenn Adams as they take a call from the grave, busk on the streets of Boston, and abscond to a rustic cabin upstate. Together, they review three out of the four stories within King's new novellas collection<em> If It Bleeds</em>: "Mr. Harrigan's Phone", "The Life of Chuck", and "Rat".

When we were here, I wanted to be there. When we were there, all we could think of was getting back to The Shop. We&apos;re here a week now, waiting to get younger, getting softer. Every minute we stay in this room, we get weaker. And every minute Andrews squats in the bush, he gets stronger. Each time we look around, the walls move in a little tighter...

			Once again, the Losers are on the lam, painting cars and hitchhiking from town to town with de-aging janitor Harlan Williams. It&apos;s the final stretch of Stephen King&apos;s Golden Years, and things are getting crazy. There are sleepovers at grave sites, references to Captain Trips, kooky hippies with equally kooky explosions, and a total Poochie ending. Join Losers Randall Colburn, Michael Roffman, and Jenn Adams as they don some tie-dye shirts, fight the good fight, and take out The Shop once and for all.

			<description>
				<![CDATA[<p>The Losers head upstate to a remote cabin to have a little R&R. Things don't go as planned, though. There isn't a Necronomicon involved or anything, but mistakes are made and blood is shed. In the distance, a dog barks. There's a chainsaw, too. Yeah. Save them, will you? Bring some snacks, maybe even a locksmith, and head to the cabin as Losers Michael Roffman, Lara Unnerstall, Dan Pfleegor, Ahse Digg, and The Horror Virgin's Jenn Adams review Stephen King's 1992 thriller Gerald's Game. Together, they discuss how the novel reflects some of King's sharpest writing to date, particularly involving female protagonists, and also share a number of revelations pertaining to their own lives. Also: Yes, there are Steve Miller Band jokes. </p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Follow us on </strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/losersclubpod/"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/LosersClubPod"><strong>Twitter</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thelosersclubpodcast/"><strong>Instagram</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.patreon.com/thebarrens/"><strong>Patreon</strong></a></p><p><br /></p><p>Hosted on Acast.

				<![CDATA[<p>The Losers head upstate to a remote cabin to have a little R&R. Things don't go as planned, though. There isn't a Necronomicon involved or anything, but mistakes are made and blood is shed. In the distance, a dog barks. There's a chainsaw, too. Yeah. Save them, will you? Bring some snacks, maybe even a locksmith, and head to the cabin as Losers Michael Roffman, Lara Unnerstall, Dan Pfleegor, Ahse Digg, and The Horror Virgin's Jenn Adams review Stephen King's 1992 thriller Gerald's Game.

Together, they discuss how the film bridges together both Stephen King&apos;s The Shining and Stanley Kubrick&apos;s 1980 adaptation, praise Rebecca Ferguson&apos;s scene-stealing performance, and debate how this all might have gone down with &quot;Hollywood Hack&quot; Akiva Goldsman.

			<description>
				<![CDATA[<p>In our final episode of coverage for <em>It: Chapter Two</em>, the Losers take one more trip into the sewers for two exclusive interviews. First, they speak with composer Benjamin Wallfisch, who weighs in on his two epic scores. Shortly after, they reunite with director Andy Muschietti, who plans to spend more time in Derry with a new supercut. He details a few deleted scenes that may be included and also shares a few anecdotes on working with Stephen King on set. This episode is sponsored by King's new novel, <em>The Institute</em>, which is out in stores now. </p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Follow us on </strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/losersclubpod/"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/LosersClubPod"><strong>Twitter</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thelosersclubpodcast/"><strong>Instagram</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.patreon.com/thebarrens/"><strong>Patreon</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Hosted on Acast.
